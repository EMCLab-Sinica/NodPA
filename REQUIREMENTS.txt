Software requirements to compile the simulator can be found in requirements.txt 

Prerequisites for compiling the NodPA middleware for deployment:
Code composer studio 12.8
MSP432 driverlib 3.21.00.05

Hardware requirements for deployment testing:
MSP-EXP432P401R LaunchPad (abbreviated as MSP432) as the intermittent system
LAUNCHXL-CC1352R1 LaunchPad (abbreviated as CC1352) as the monitoring board
Cypress CY15B116QN FRAM (abbreviated as CY15B116QN) as the external NVM


	Wire connections related to EHM:
    Connect BAT and VBAT_OK of CJMCU-25504 to 5LP01SP PMOS, 5LN01SP NMOS and a large resistor (e.g., 10MÎ©) as shown in EHM_circuit.png
Schematic of evaluation hardware setup

    Wire connection with MSP432 and the monitoring board (CC1352):
    CC1352 GND   <-> MSP432 GND
    CC1352 DIO16 <-> MSP432 P5.5 for counting inferences
    CC1352 DIO11 <-> MSP432 3V3  for checking power on/off

    Wire connection with MSP432 and EHM:
    EHM GND  <-> MSP432 GND
    EHM VOUT <-> MSP432 3V3 for providing energy to MSP432

    Wire connection with MSP432 and external NVM (CY15B116QN):
    CY15B116QN GND <-> MSP432 GND
    CY15B116QN 3V3 <-> MSP432 3V3  for providing energy to CY15B116QN
    CY15B116QN CS  <-> MSP432 P1.5 for enabling/disabling CY15B116QN from MSP432
    CY15B116QN SDI <-> MSP432 P2.3 for sending data from MSP432 to CY15B116QN
    CY15B116QN SDO <-> MSP432 P2.2 for sending data from CY15B116QN to MSP432
    CY15B116QN SCK <-> MSP432 P2.1 for synchronizing bits between MSP432 and CY15B116QN
